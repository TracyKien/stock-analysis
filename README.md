# VBA Challenge

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Steve, a recent finance graduate, help his parents with their stocks. They invested all of their funds into DAQO New Energy Corp without doing any research on the company. He wants us to help analyze a handful of green energy stocks in additional to DAQO stocks to help diversify their funds. By using VBA, a programming language for Excel, I will be helping him create macros to help automate tasks and reviewing the data that Steve has provided us. This will alsp help him analyze new data in the future if he needs it.
