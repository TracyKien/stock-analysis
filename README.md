# VBA Challenge

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Steve, a recent finance graduate, help his parents with their stocks. They invested all of their funds into DAQO New Energy Corp without doing any research on the company. He wants us to help analyze a handful of green energy stocks in additional to DAQO stocks to help diversify their funds. By using VBA, a programming language for Excel, I will be helping him create macros to help automate tasks and reviewing the data that Steve has provided us. This will alsp help him analyze new data in the future if he needs it. 

## Results
Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

I created a code to help Steve figure out the return of different green energy stocks to see whether or not some would be worth looking into for his parents for them to diversify their funds. The code tells Steve what tickers had a positive or negative return for that year. After running the code, Steve will be able to compare data from 2017 vs 2018 easier than looking at each indiviual line from his dataset. By doing this, Steve can see that ENPH and RUN has positive returns for both 2017 and 2018. This indicates that these are two possible companies that Steve can advise his parents to invest into. See the two images below for visual examples of this data.
